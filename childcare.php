            </h2>
            <br>
            <p style="color: black;" class="lead1">Caring for a newborn can get a bit overwhelming, especially if it is your first time being a parent. From irregular feeding patterns to innumerable diaper changes, the first three months of motherhood take quite a toll on your regular life and routines. That is the time when you desperately need some parenting tips for infants. Here are few tips you can keep in mind while caring for a newborn.</p>

                </h3>

                <p class="lead1">As per a recent study, holding your baby in your arms and cuddling them has a huge impact on their brain development. This is especially true if the baby is premature. The supportive skin-to-skin touch of a parent gives out a positive and nurturing vibe making the baby feel loved and secure. So, one of the best positive parenting tips is, go ahead and cradle your baby as much as you like. After all, they will outgrow your arms in a jiffy!</p>

                </h3>

                <p class="lead1">Giving your baby a bath can get a bit tricky, especially if they do not enjoy it. Give them warm sponge baths upto the age of three months. If they enjoy their baths, you can give them a sponge bath everyday, or every two to three days if they do not like the feel of water. It is best to limit bath time to around five to ten minutes since newborns have very sensitive skin.</p>

                </h3>

                <p class="lead1">Worried your infant is crying all the time? Up until the age of six months, the only way babies can communicate and emote their feelings is by crying. Though you will be rewarded with a heart-warming smile or cooing sounds once in a while, crying is the only way they can let you know that they need something. So instead of doubting if you have got the qualities of good parents, just be patient and address your baby’s cries with a good feed, diaper change or just some good-old cuddling time.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="lead1" style="color: black;">Right from when your little one is born till the age of three years, their little brain develops at the speed of light - with more than a million neural connections per second to be precise. Additionally, apart from nutrition, the rate at which their brain develops depends on a multitude of external factors. Few of them are discussed below:</p>

                </h3>

                <p class="lead1">The importance of parenting in child development is huge. Make sure you spend as much time as possible with your newborn to aid, as much as possible, in their brain development. Homes that provide a nourishing environment with a lot of love and encouragement will have a positive impact on the child’s development as well. On the other hand, a stressful atmosphere at home can wean children away from their valuable time with parents, which is never a good sign.</p>

                </h3>

                <p class="lead1">There is no doubt that breast milk is the best nutrition you can give your baby. Apart from a host of developmental benefits, breast milk will protect your baby from allergies, diseases, ear infections and a multitude of other external viruses. You can also introduce your baby to solid food while breastfeeding. Start with fresh fruits and wholesome grains to make a tailor-made meal plan that stimulates muscle, bone and brain development.</p>

                <p class="lead1">Interacting with your child is considered as one of the best qualities of good parents. Talking to your child on a regular basis plays a huge role in the brain development of the child. Daily habits like reading a book to them and telling them stories in an illustrative manner can stimulate their brain cells and pave way for good creativity and imagination. It is also a good idea to introduce them to toys, books and other objects that affect cognitive development.</p>

            <p style="color: black;" class="lead1">For parents who have spent many tired nights up with their child, how to make a child sleep can be one of the most pressing concerns. Setting a proper night time routine in place is one of the most important positive parenting tips you need to consider to surpass the effects of early parenthood. A good sleep pattern not only results in your baby being happy and healthy, but it also gives you some me-time to sit back and relax.</p>

                <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="color:#217485">Consistency is key
                </h3>

                <p class="lead1">Routines are everything when it comes to early parenthood. Create a nighttime routine which will instantly signal your child’s brain that sleep time is approaching. Whether it is a warm bath or reading out their favourite bedtime story, inculcate a bedtime routine and get your child to sleep on their own. A predictable routine is essential to how to fall asleep fast for kids.</p>

                </h3>

                <p class="lead1">Putting your little one to sleep immediately after dinner is not a good idea because their bodies will be active and alert to digest what just got in. Opt for an early dinner instead, with ample time for digestion, so your child will get naturally tired. This is one of the most useful tricks to get toddlers to sleep. However, one of the top positive parenting tips is to make sure you keep sugary treats at bay to keep their energy levels in check.</p>

                <p class="lead1">One of the most effective parenting tips for toddlers is, try keeping electronic screens away before bedtime. There are many negative effects of staring at a screen for too long and your tiny tot’s precious eyes are no exception to this. Not only does TV time strain their eyes, it also keeps the brain alert well after it is switched off, which can hamper their sleep.</p>

                <p class="lead1">One of the main reasons why inducing a bedtime routine is important is because of the major role sleep plays in the brain development of your child. During the active REM cycle of sleep, key brain cell connections are developed and a vital layer of fat called myelin is created on the fibres of the nerves. Additionally, sleep also helps in creating stronger connections between the left and right hemispheres of the brain.</p>

                <p class="lead1">If you want to know how to increase immunity in a child naturally, a good diet is the secret! Adding a generous amount of nutritious fruits and vegetables to your little one’s diet will help them produce white blood cells that fight infection and other ailments. Whether it is in the form of a smoothie or baked snacks, make sure your little one has at least five servings of fruits and vegetables in their daily diet.</p>

                <p class="lead1">It is best to quit smoking altogether at least after childbirth. However, if you still feel the urge to smoke, make sure it is not in front of your child. Passive smoking can lead to harmful diseases like asthma and bronchitis. Furthermore, your child’s body is still developing a detoxification process and cigarette smoke is the last thing you want them to deal with.</p>

It is also important to develop good habits and manners like brushing your teeth before sleeping for good dental hygiene.
